Watch the robot in action [in this awesome video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-_uxpX9aFQ&feature=youtu.be).

I found out about this robot from [3ders.org](http://www.3ders.org/articles/20131029-b-robot-a-fully-3d-printed-self-balancing-arduino-robot.html) while I was googling for 3d printable robot bodies. The picture above is from their article.
